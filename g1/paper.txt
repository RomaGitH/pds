Intro:
	pitch quantization system which can produce pitch corrected, pitch shifted and or reharmonized;
Requirements:
Design:
	The system divides input audio into three nonoverlapping blocks of L=1024(256) samples at 44.1 kHz
(8kHz), producing an ideal latency of one frame, or 23.2ms
(32ms).
	Autocorrelation (qué metodos) to find pitch period pp
	The quantization block chooses a new pitch period pp’ from a lookup table comprised of pitch periods corresponding to the notes of a specific musical scale
	PSOLA
Enhancements:
Enhancements psola resynthesis: grains(ruido)?
Enhancements transient(energy bursts/ruido/artefacto): zero crosing...por frame: si cruza mucha veces ceros entonces no corrige el pitch de ese frame;
Pitch period quantizer: tabla de pitches;
Ejemplo:
shit: -glutteral souns
      -high female singers at low sample rate 
      -not fully automatic pitch quantization
      -cross platform not so efficient
